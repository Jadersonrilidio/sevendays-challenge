### 7 Days of Code challenge in PHP

After the challenge has already been completed ([see my final version here](https://github.com/Jadersonrilidio/sevendays-challenge/tree/master/_old) and [raw version here](https://github.com/Jadersonrilidio/sevendays-challenge/tree/master/_raw)), the whole project was migrated to an MVC arquitecture in OOP, still, lacks support to database connection and many other features that fit helpfull for the future endeavors of the project, considering future amendments, new features and project growth as a whole.

This challenge was taken from the site [https://7daysofcode.io/](https://7daysofcode.io/) and provided by [Alura Academy](https://www.alura.com.br/).
